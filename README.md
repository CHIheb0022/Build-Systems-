# Build System Learning Repository

Welcome to the Build System Learning Repository! This repository is dedicated to learning Makefile and CMake, two popular build systems used in embedded software development. Through this learning path, you will explore the fundamentals of these build systems and practice using them locally.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main subfolders:

1. **Cmake course**: This folder contains materials and exercises related to learning CMake, a cross-platform build system generator widely used in C++ projects.

2. **Make course**: Here, you'll find resources and tasks focused on understanding Makefile, a build automation tool used primarily for compiling and linking source code files.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the materials provided in this repository, it's recommended to have a basic understanding of the following:

- C/C++ programming language fundamentals
- Familiarity with the command line interface (CLI)
- Basic understanding of software development concepts such as compiling, linking, and building projects

## Setting Up the Environment

To effectively follow along with the learning materials in this repository, you'll need to set up the environment for CMake and Make. Here's a brief guide on how to do that:

### Installing CMake

1. Visit the [official CMake website](https://cmake.org/download/) to download the latest version of CMake for your operating system.
2. Follow the installation instructions provided for your specific platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).
3. After installation, verify that CMake is correctly installed by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing `cmake --version`.

### Installing Make

- **Linux**: Most Linux distributions come with Make pre-installed. If it's not available, you can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run `sudo apt install build-essential` to install Make along with other essential build tools.
- **macOS**: Make is included with the Xcode Command Line Tools. You can install it by running `xcode-select --install` in the terminal.
- **Windows**: Make is not natively available on Windows. However, you can install it using tools like MinGW or Cygwin. Alternatively, you can use Make provided by development environments like MSYS2.

## Getting Started

To start your learning journey with either CMake or Make, navigate to the respective folder and explore the provided materials. Each session is designed to gradually introduce concepts and provide hands-on exercises to reinforce your understanding.

## Contributing

If you have suggestions for improving the learning materials, or if you encounter any issues, feel free to contribute by submitting a pull request or opening an issue. Your feedback is valuable in enhancing the learning experience for everyone.

Happy learning!
